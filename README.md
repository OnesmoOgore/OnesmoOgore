# 👋 Hi, I’m Onesmo

**Embedded & Robotics / Imaging Software Engineer** with a systems background in:

- 🎛️ **Embedded / low-level**: C / C++, device interfaces, microcontrollers, motion control
- 🧠 **Robotics & automation**: gantry systems, motion profiles, control loops, V&V tooling
- 🩻 **Imaging / med-device**: optics, color pipelines (XYZ/Lab, ΔE2000), image processing
- 🖥️ **Desktop & test tools**: C# / .NET (WPF), C++ backends, Python automation & analysis

I’m currently **open to roles** in:

> **Robotics, Embedded Systems, Imaging / Optics, or Medical Device Software**  
> (backend / low-level, device control, test & validation tooling)

## 🔧 Tech I Work With

**Languages**

- C, C++
- C# (.NET, WPF, MFC)
- Python (automation, data analysis, OpenCV, tooling)
- Some LabVIEW, MATLAB, scripting & batch / shell
- PIC MPLAB X

**Domains**

- Embedded firmware, microcontrollers, device drivers
- Motion control, robotics motion/actuators/sensors & detection algorithms
- Image & color processing (XYZ, Lab, ICC, ΔE)
- Test automation, V&V pipelines, hardware-in-the-loop

**Tools & Frameworks**

- .NET / WPF, Visual Studio
- OpenCV / EmguCV
- Git, CMake, pytest / unit testing
- CAD & simulation: SolidWorks, AutoCAD, ANSYS (for mechanical/optical context)

## 📦 Flagship Projects (in progress)

I’m building out a set of public projects that reflect the kind of work I do:

1. **embedded-motor-pid-controller**  
   Minimal embedded C PID controller for a DC motor, with simulation plots and docs.

2. **gantry-ros2-motion-control**  
   ROS2 package that simulates a 2-axis gantry with position commands, limits and simple trajectory planning.

3. **spectral-to-lab-color-pipeline**  
   Python tools to convert spectral data → XYZ → Lab, and compute ΔE2000 for color validation.

4. **wpf-device-control-demo**  
   C# / WPF desktop app that talks to a mock device (or microcontroller) over serial, with logging and MVVM structure.

5. **embedded-test-harness**  
   Python-based automated test harness that sends commands to an embedded board, validates responses, and logs results.

_As I publish these repos, I’ll pin them below and expand the READMEs with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and example data._

## 🤝 Open Source & Interests

I’m especially interested in contributing to:

- **ROS2** (robotics middleware, motion control, simulation)
- **OpenCV** and computer vision tooling
- **Medical imaging / visualization** (ITK, VTK, 3D Slicer, etc.)
- Color & imaging pipelines (ICC profiles, calibration, validation)

If you maintain a project in these areas and are open to contributions, I’d be happy to collaborate.
