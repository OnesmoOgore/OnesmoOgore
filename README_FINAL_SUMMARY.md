- Shows both technical depth AND personality

### Expected Outcomes (4-8 weeks):

✅ **2-3x more recruiter contacts** (from better LinkedIn keywords)
✅ **Higher-quality job matches** (medical device, robotics, embedded)
✅ **Better interview conversations** (portfolio as conversation starter)
✅ **Increased credibility** (GitHub shows you walk the talk)
